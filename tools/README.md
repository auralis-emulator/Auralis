# Tools

This directory contains several scripts which are intended to both document and ease the convenience of certain development processes.

The scripts in this directory assume that your current working directory is the Auralis root directory and the script is being called via `./tools/xxx.sh`.

## Pre-release checklist

- [ ] Update compatibility list
- [ ] If this is a major release (2123.1 -> major.minor), update translations

### Note:

For reasons unknown, some part of the translation update process can inexplicably produce files with different content depending on the environment in which it is running, even when using the same version of the tool and the same distro.

For consistency, when updating the translations to be committed to the repository, always perform the update within the the Docker environment we use for Auralis's CI (`opensauce04/auralis-build-environment:latest`).
